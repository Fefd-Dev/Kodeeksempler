# Privacy Policy

At HALP, we value your privacy and have a strong focus on keeping your data secure. This privacy policy contains information about how we collect, and use your information.
By using the Help Assistant Lab Program (HALP) you consent to the collection, use and sharing of the information as stated in this privacy policy.

## Information we collect
The usage of HALP is not restricted to logging in as a user. The system provides the ability to use it without logging in using your email address and nickname. This leaves two scenarios:

### Information collected if logged in
- Personal information: We may collect information such as your email address, nickname and discord tag. There is no need to actually enter your real name, which is why this field is called "nickname"
- Ticket information: We may collect information created by you in the app, such as tickets, courses and user roles. This content is all stored in the HALP system until you decide to remove it yourself.

### Information collected if not logged in
- Personal information: We may collect information such as your nickname and discord tag. There is no need to actually enter your real name, which is why this field is called "nickname"
- Ticket information: We may collect information created by you in the app, such as tickets, courses and user roles. This content is all stored in the HALP system until you decide to remove it yourself.

## How we use your information
The information we collect is used in the HALP system to provide you with the full experience of the system.

## Deleting your information
The deletion of information is very quickly and simply done by clicking the "Delete Personal Data" button in the profile settings.
This action will remove **all information connected to the user** from the system, and **it is not possible to retrieve it afterwards**. 

## Sharing of information
HALP does not share your information with any third parties, and has no plans to do so in the future.
The data collected is solely for using the HALP system, and we have no need or desire to pass it on to anyone else.

## How we protect your information
We use reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and use. No security system is perfect, however, and we can unfortunately not guarantee that your information will be completely secure for all eternity.

## Changes to this privacy policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you by posting a notice in the app and on the website.
